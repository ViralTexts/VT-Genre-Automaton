unable sooner to return, which fact
shall be fully reported to the Chinese
consul at the port of departure, and by
him certified to the satisfaction of the
collector at the port at which Buch,
Chinese subject shall land in the,
United ' States of America. Artic'e
III.-The provisions of this convention
sholl not affect the rights at present
enjoyed of Chinese subjects being ,,',
officials, teachers, students,
merchante, travellers for curiosity or
pleasure,, but . not,¡labourers, of
coming to the United .'States'of
.America and residing therein. To
entitle, such Chinese subjects' as are
?r-above-described- to admission into
the United States of , America, they may
- produce certificates from their Gov-
ernment, or.'the government where they
have resided, issued by-- ' the
diplomatic or consular representative of
the - United States of - America in the
country or port whence they deÎiart.
'It' is also agreed that Chinese
abonrers shall continue to enjoy the
privilege 'of transit across the
territory of the United States of
America in the course of their journey
to or .from other countries, subject to
such regulations by the Government of
the United States of America as may be
necessary to prevent , snchi privilege
.of transit from being abused. Article
rV-T-In pursuance of article .lu. of the
Immigration Treaty between ,.the,United
States and China, signed at Pekin the
17th day of November, 1880, it Is hereby
understood and agreed that ChineBe
labourers or Chinese of any other class,
either permanently or temporarily in the
United States, shall have for the
protection of their persons and pro-
perty all the rights that are given by
the laws of the United States to
citizens of the most favoured nation,
excepting the right to become
natuarlised citizens, ana the Government
of the United States re-affirms its
obligation, as stated in the said
Article III., to exert all its powers to
secare protection tofpersons and
property of all Chinese subjects in the
United States. ArticloV.-Whereas Chinese
subjects in remote and unsettled regions
in the United States have been victims
of injury in their persons and property
at the hands of wicked and lawless men,
which unexpected éventa the Chinese
Govern-ment regrets, and for which it
has olairaed an indemnity, the legal
obligation of which the Government of
the United States denies ; and, whereas,
the Government of the United States,
humanely consider-ing these injuries,
and bearing in mind the firm and ancient
friendship between the United States and
China which the high contracting parties
wish to cement, is ?desirous of
alleviating the exceptional and
'deplorable suffering and losses to
which 'the aforesaid Chinese have been
subjected ; therefore, the United
States, without re-ference to the
question of liability, there-fore
(which, as a legal allegation, it
denies) agrees to pay, on or before the
1st day of March, 1889, the sum of
276,619 75dol. ""to the Chinese Minister
at this capital, who shall accept the
same on behalf of his Government as full
indemnity for, all losses and injuries
sustained by the Chi-nese subjects as
aforesaid, and shall dis, tribute the
said money among the said sufferers and
their relatives. Article VI.-This
convention shall re-main in force for a
period of 20 years, beginning with the
date of exchange of 'ratification, and
if six months before the 'expiration of
the said period of 20 years
'neither'Government shall formally have
have given notice of ita termination to
the oth'er, It shall remain in force for
another like period of 20 yean. ¡ U The
>Alta -, California &lt; writes :-The
treaty which has been some time in
.negotiation is, in fact, much stronger
than tit ! was expected to . be. It
absolutely excludes Chinese immi-
gration. It cuts off the Hong Kong
stream at ita source. .. It also ends
the prior resi-dence plea, and nullifies
the promiscuous -return-certificate."" It
closes this country .completely to 'new
immigrants. It ' does this, as we
believe; without requiring any ""Act of
Congress. The Treasury'depart-ment needs
only to conform its regulations to~the
terms* of'the treaty. Of all the Chinese
now v here, only those ? who have the
right of'return who have families or
&lt; who have l,000dol. in ' real pro-
perty. This confines the right ( of
return ,to a few hundreds only, for' we
'doubt whether the two classes will
aggregate a thousand people. Accord-ing
to its terms, probably not more thanl
per cent, of Chinese will have the
right, to return to the country after
quitting it. Those who have the right to
return muBt establish it before they go.
if they laave families, they must prove
it before embarking. If they leave
realty they must submit evidence of it.
This evidence will be difficult to use
corruptly. No record of it will be given
to the party himself. If he sells his
chance to another to get in on a false
impersonation, the fraud «rill be easy
of detection, linos he must trus* to, bi
own memory to tutor hU tuhrtttqt«, fetd,
