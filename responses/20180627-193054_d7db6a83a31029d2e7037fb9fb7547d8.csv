n. m.?The initial light of Colonel
Wood's rough riders and the troopers of
the First and Tenth regular cavalry, will
be known in history as ""the battle of
La Quaslnn."" Thnt It did not end In
the complete slaughter of the Ameri­
cans was not due to apy miscalcula­
tion in the plan of the Spaniards, for as
perfect on ambuscade as was ever
formed in the brain of an Apache In­
dian, was prepared, and Lieutenant Col­
onel Roosevelt and his men walked
6quarely into it. For- an hour and a
half they held their ground under a
perfect storm of bullets from the front
and sides and then Colonel ""Wood at the
right and Lieutenant Colonel Roosevelt
ct the left, led a charge which turned
the tide of battle and sent the enemy
flying over the hills toward Santiago.
It Is now definitely known that sir­
teen men on the American side were
killed, while sixty were wounded or are
reported to be missing.
It is Impossible to calculate the Span­
ish losses, but it Is known that the*'
were heavier than those of the Ameri­
cans, at least as regards actual loss of
life. Already thirty-seven dead Span­
ish soldiers have been found and burled,
while many others undoubtedly ore ly­
ing In the thick underbrush on the
side of the gully and on the slope of the
hill where the main body of the enemy
was located. The wounded were all re- 1
moved. J
A complete list of the killed, wounded !
and missing on the American side, re- !

who were reported yesterday,as among
the dead or wounded, were unharmed

tant Ilall reported as mortally wound­
ed.
Spaniards Thoronqhly Poateit.
That the Spaniards were thoroughly
posted as to the route to be taken by
the Americans In their movement to­
wards Seville, was evident, as shown by
the careful preparations they had made.
The main body of the Spaniards was
posted on a hill, on the heavily wooded
slopes of which had been erected two
block houses, flanked by Irregular en­
trenchments of stone and fallen trees.
At the bottom of these hills run two
roadvertisement along whloh Lieutenant Colonel
Roosevelt's men and eight troops of the
First and Tenth cavalry with a battery
of four Howitzers, advanced. These
roadvertisement are but little more than pulleys,
rough and -narrow and at places almost
impassable. In these trails the fight oc­
curred. Nearly half a mile separated
Roosevelt's' men from the regulars, and
between them and on both sides of the
road in the thick underbrush was con­
cealed a force of Spaniards* that must
have been large, judging from the ter­
rific and constant fire they poured In
on the Americans.
The fight was opened by the First and
Tenth cavalry, under General Young. A
force of Spaniards was known to be In
the vicinity of La Quasina. and early In
the morning Lieutenant Colonel Roose­
velt's men started oft up the precipi­
tous bluff back of Slboney to attack the
Spaniards on their right flank, General
Young at the same time taking the road
at the foot of the hill. About two and
a half miles out from Slboney some Cu­
bans, breathless and excited, rushed In
the camp with the announcement that
the Spaniards were but a little way la
front and were strongly entrenched.
Quickly the Ilotchklss guns out In the
front were brought to the rear, while a
strong scouting line was thrown out.
Then cautiously and In silence the
troops moved forward until a bend in
the road disclosed a -hill where the
Spaniards were located. The guns were
again brought to the front and placed In
position, while the men crouched down
in the road, waiting impatiently to give
Roosevelt's men who were tolling over
the little trail along the crest of the
rldgc, time to get up.
Tlir Open lug Fire.
At 7:30 n. m. General Young gave
the command to the men at the Hotch­
klps guns to open fire. The command
was the signal for a fight that for stub­
bornness has seldom been equalled. The
Instant the Hotchkiss guns wore fired,
the hillsides commanding the road gave
forth volley after volley from the Mau­
sers of the Spaniards.
""Don't shoot until you see something
to shoot at,"" yelled General Young, and
the men with set Jaws and gleaming
eyes, obeyed the order. Crawling along
the edge of the road and protecting
themselves as much as possible from
the fearful fire of the Spaniards, the
troopers, some of them stripped to the
waist, watched the base of the hill and
when any part of a Spaniard became
visible they fired. Never for an Instant
did1 they falter.
One husky warrior of the Tenth cav­
alry with a ragged wound In his thigh,
coolly knelt behind a Tock, loading and
firing and when told by one of his com­
rades that he was wounded, laughed
and said: ""Oh, that's all right. That's
been there for some time.""
In the meantime, nway off to the left
could he heard the crack of the rifles of
Colonel Wood's men and the regulur,
deeper-toned volley firing of the Span­
lards. Over thero the American losses
were the greatest.­
Colonel Wood's inen with an advance
guard well out In front and two Cuban
guides before them, but apparently with
no flankers, went squarely Into the trap
set for them by the Spaniards and only
the unfaltering courage of the men In
the face of a lire that would even mako
a veteran quail,, prevented what might
easily have been a disaster. As It was,
TrOop L. the ndvance guard, under the
unfortunate Captain Capron, was al­
most surrounded and but for the rein­
forcement hurriedly sent forward, ev­
ery man would probably have been kill­
ed or wounded.
Aot nn Amrrlcmi I'llncltril.
""There must have been nearly l,f.0f?
Spaniards In front and to the sides of
us,"" sold Lieutenant Colonol Roosevelt
to-day, when discussing the fight.
""They held the ridges with rifle pits
and machine guns and had a body of
men In ambush in the thick Jungle at
the sides of the road over which wo
.were advancing. Our advance guard
struck the men In ambush and drove
thorn out. But they lost.'Captaln Ca­
pron, Lieutenant Thomas and about fif­
teen men killed or wounded. ?
""The Spanish llrlng was accurate, so
accurate Indeed, that It -surprised rne,
and Ihelr firing was fearfully heavy.""
""E want to nay a word for ohr own
men,"" continued Lieutenant Colonol

Itoo??velt. ""Every odlcer and man did
llll diltK Up to tho handle. Not n man
flinched. From another ofiler who took
a prominent part In tlie (lRhtlnK, more
details U'oro obtained. ""When the fir­
In* bfmin,"" nald he. ""Lieutenant Colo­
nel Roosevelt took the right wlnir with
Troop G nnd K. under Captain Llewel­
'vn and Captain Jenkn and moved to
the support of Captain Capron, who
was getting It hard. At the tamo lime
Colonol Wood nnd Major BrOdle took
tho left wing and advanced In open or­
der on the Spanlih right wing. Major
Urodle was wounded before the troops I
had advanced one hundred yards. Colo­
nel Wood then took the right win*and
shifted Colonel Roosoveltrto tho loft.
IlooMvelt hi the I.eml.
""In tho meantime the Are of the I
Spaniards had increased In volume, hut
notwithstanding this an order for
general charge was given, and with
yell tho men sprang forward. Colonel
Roosevelt In front of his men, snatched
a rifle and ammunition belt from a
wounded soldier and cheering nnd yell­
ing with his men, led tho advance. For
a moment the bullets were singing like
a swarm of bees all round them, and
every instant some poor fellow wont
down. On the right wing Captain Mc­
Cllntock had his leg broken by a bullet
from a machine gun. while four of his
men went down. At the same time Cap­
tain Luna, of Troop F, lost nine of his
men. Then the reserves, Troops IC and
E, were ordered up. Colonel Wood with
the right wing, charged straight at
blockhouse eight hundred yards away
and Colonel Roosevelt on the left
charged at the same time. Up the men
went, yelling like fiends and never
stopping to return the fire of the Span­
lards, but keeping on with a grim de­
termination to capture the blockhouse.
""That charge was the end. When
within five hundred yards of the covet­
ed point theSpanlardsbroke and ran,and
for the first time we had the pleasure
which the Spaniards had been experi­
encing all through the engagement of I
shooting with the enemy In sight.""

m.?""In the two hours' lighting during
which the volunteers battled against
their concealed enemy, enough deeds of
heroism were done to fill a volume. One
of the men of Troop B, desperately
wounded, was lying squarely 'between
the lines of fire. Surgeon Church hur­
ried to his side and, with bullets pelt­
ing all around him, calmly dressed the
man's wound, bandaged It and walked
unconcernedly back, 600n returning
with two men and a Utter. The wound­
ed man was placcd on the litter and
brought Into our lines. Another soldier
of Troop L,-concealing himself as best
he could behind a tree, gave up his
place to a wounded companion and
moment or two later was himself |
wounded.
""Sergeant Bell stood by the side of
Captain Capron -when the latter was
mortally hit. lie had seen that he was
lighting against terrible odds, but he
never flinched. 'Give me four gun
minute,' he sold to the sergeant, and
kneellncj down, he deliberately olmed
and fired two shots In quick succession.
At each a Spaniard was seen to fall.
Bell In the meantime had seized a dead
comrade's gun and knelt beside his cap­
tain and fired steadily.
""When Captain Capron fell he gave
the sergeant a parting message to his
wife and father and bade the sergeant
good-bye In a cheerful voice and was
then borne away, dying.
Sergeant Hamilton Fish, Jr., was the
first man killed by the Spanish fire. He
wns near the head of the column as It
turned from the wood road Into rnnge
of the Spanish ambuscade. He shot one
Spaniard who was firing from the cover
of a dense patch of underbrush. When
a bullet struck his breast he sank at
the foot of a tree with his back against
It. Captain Capron stood over him
shooting and others rallied around him,
covering the wounded man. The ground
this afternoon was thick with empty
shells, where Fish lay. He lived twenty­
minutes. He gave a small lady's hunt­
ing case watch from his belt to a mess­
mate as a last souvenir.
""With the exception of Captain Ca­
pron, all the rough riders killed In yes­
terday's fight were burled this morning
on the field of action. Their bodies were
laid in one long trench, each wrapped
In a blnnket. Palm leaves lined the
trench and were heaped In profusion
over the dead heroes. Chaplain Brown
read the beautiful Episcopal burial ser­
vice for the dead and as he knelt in
prayer, every trooper, with bared head,
knelt around the trench. When the
chaplain announced the hymn ""Nearer
My God to Thee,"" the deep bass voices
of the men gave a most Impressive ren­
dering of the music. The dead rough
riders rest right on the summit of the
hill where they fell. The site Is most
beautiful. A growth of rich, luxuriant
grass and flowers covers the slopes and
from the top a far-reaching view Ih had
over the tropical forest. Chaplain
Brown has marked cash grave nnd has
complete records of the dead for the
benefit of friends of the soldiers.
""Captain- Capron's body was brought
Into Juragua. this afternoon, but It was
deemed Inadvisable to send tho remains
north at thin season nnd the Interment
took place on a hillside near the sea­
shore, back of the provisional hospital.
""After a brief service a parting vol­
ley wns flrod over the grave of tho
dead captain and bugle Hounded 'taps'
ns the sun sank over tho mountain
tops beyond Santiago.""
