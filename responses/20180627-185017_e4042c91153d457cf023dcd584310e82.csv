The Pursuit of Happiness

When the Declaration of Independence
asserted man's right to this, it enunciated
an immortal truth. The bilious sufferer is
on the road to happiness when he begins to
take Hostetter's Stomach Bitters, the most
efficacious regulator of the liver in exit,
tence. Equally reliable is it in chills and
fever, constipation, dyspepsia, rheumatism,
kidney trouble and nervousness. Use it
regularly, and not at odd intervals.

""So THE insolent fellow refused to pay his
rent. ""He did not say so in words, but be
intimated it."" ""How so?"" ""Ho kicked me
downstairs.' '—Figaro.

The Trne Laxative Principle.

Of the plants used in manufacturing the
pleasant remedy, Syrup of Figs, has a per­
manently benelicial effccfc on the human sys»
tem, while the cheap vegetable extracts and
mineral solutions, usually sold as mcdicines,
are permanently injurious. Being well in­
formed, you will use the true remedy only.

himself busy in this world."" ""Well, you
don't blame him for staying away from
home, do you!""— Life.
