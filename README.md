# VT-Genre-Automaton
## A Viral Texts Project Crowdsourcing App

The Viral Texts Genrea Automaton works by presenting the results of our classification experiments to interested readers via a web application created using RStudio’s Shiny framework. The app presents a newspaper text—or rather its OCR—alongside a question about the classifier’s accuracy. For example, for a text that was classified as “literary”, the Automaton states, “This text is classified as LITERARY. Does that seem right?” Below, a description of what we mean by “literary” is given: “In our corpus, literary texts can be poetry or prose such as sermons, sketches, vignettes, or essays.” The user can choose “Yes” to agree with the classifier, “No” to disagree, or “Not sure.” If the user disagrees with the genre classification, they are asked to choose a label from among our other classified genres: news, advertisement, or informational. There is also an option for “other” that allows the user to answer the question “How would you classify this text?” If the user selects “Not sure,” the Automaton asks “What makes this difficult to classify?,” and users can choose from the following options: “The OCR is bad; None of the genres apply; There’s a mix of genres.” In addition to a means for checking our classifier and introducing our corpus to interested readers, the results generated from the Genre Automaton becomes training data for for future classification efforts.
