is the poem:
By the merest chance, iathe twilight gloom,
In the orchard path ho met mi—
In the tall, wet grass, with its faint perfume*,
And I tried to puss, but he inside no room,
Oh! I tried, but he would not let me,
So I stood and blushed till the grass grew red,
With my face bent down above it,
While he took my hand as he whispering said—
How the clover lifted each pink sweet head
To listen to all that my lover Raid!
Oh! the clover in bloom—l love it!
In the high, wet grass went the path to hide,
And the low, wet leaves hung over,
But I could not pass on either side,
For ! found myself, when I vainly tried,
In the arms of my steadfast lover,
And he held me there, and he raised my bead,
While he closed the path before me,
And he looked down into my eyes and said—
How the leaves bent down from the bough
o'erhead,
To listen to all that my lover said,
Oh! the leaves hanging lowly o'er me.
Had he moved aside but a little way
I could surely then have passed him.
And he knew I could never wish to sta},
And would not have heard what he had to say,
Could I only aside have cast him.
It was almost dark, and the moments sped,
And the searching night wind found us;
But he drew me nearer and softly said—
How the pure, sweet wind grew still in«t."":id
To listen to all that my lover said,
Oh, the whispering ""wind around 11-.
I am sure he knew, when he held m>' fast,
That I must be all unwilling ;
For I tried to go, and would have passed
As the night was come with its dews at last.
And the sky with its stars was filling.
But he clasped me close, when I would have
fled.
And he made me hear his story.
And his soul came out from his lip:- and said—
How the stars crept out wh'-u the white moon
led
To listen to all that my lover said.
Oh, the moon and the stars in glory!
I know that the grass and the leaves will not
ten,
And I'm sure that the wind, precious rover,
Will carry his secret so safely and well
That no being shall ever discover
One word of the many that rapidly fell
From the eager lips of my lover.
And the moon and the stars they looked over
Shall never reveal what a fairylike spell
They wove around us that night in the
dell,
In the path through the dew-laden clover;
or echo the whispers '-\\.d mad • my heart
swell
As they fell from the lipe of my lover.

Then Mr. Hill said: ""I was in Seat­
tle. W. T. some years ago—two or
three—when Mr. C.H.Larrabee of that
place recited that poem. I was so
pleased with it that I obtained a copy
and committed it to memory. Mr.
Larrabee told me that he had cut it
from the Evening Pbst of New York­
some twenty-five years before. In
that publication it was ascribed to
Horace Greeley. I promised to look
Up the history of it. but all my endeav­
ors up to this time have proved un­
availing.""
'•I remember the poem."" spoke
Curtis; "" I cut it from the Su/i some
sixteen years ago. I think it was the
Sun, any way, it was given as anony­
mous, and ifGreeley wrote it certainly
Mr. Dunn wonld have known it. and
probably have seen that it: was duly
credited.""

This statement, having so many
hypothetical conditions, was not re
garded as important, and a committee
formed itself then and there to settle
the question, and make the history a
matter of record. Although they have
made search they have so far found
notliing.
