eaid unto Jusus, And who is my neighborb?""
He could not say be had kept the law; it
Condemned him and proved him guilty, but
he was not willing to own It and plead
guilty. He would rather, if possible, establish
nig own righteousness, thus proving I
himself ignorant of God's righteousness,
even the Christ with whom he was talking,
who is the end of the law for righteousness
to every one that believeth"" (Bom. x., 8, 4;
II Oor. v., 21).
30. ""And Jesus, answering, said, A car- ,
tain man went down from Jerusalem to
Jericho and fell among thieves, which 1
stripped him of his raiment and wounded
him and departed, leaving him half dead.'^
By a clear-and simple illustration Jesus'
would patiently show this one who tempted
H m the meaning of the word ""neighbor."" j
The poor robbed ani wounded and helpless ,
man is suggestive of the forlorn and help- J
less condition of the sinner whom satan has &lt;
cost down, but th9 sinner Is wholly and not ,
half dead (Eph. ii.,5). ' !
31. ""And by ohance there came down a '
certain priest that w*y, and when he saw '
him he passed by on the other side."" The
priest's lips should keep knowledge (Mai. 1
ii., 7). tut Jetus said to the lawyers that
they had taken away the key of knowledge,
not entering themselves and hindering 1
those who would enter (Luke xi., 52). Ha 1
also pronounced a woe upon the lawyers beÂ­
cause they loaded people with burdens
which they themselves would not touch with 1
one of their fingers (xi., 46). i
32. ""And likewise a Levite, when he waa
at the place, came and looked on him and
passed by on the other side."" Levi Is the;
third person ot whom it i9 said in Scripture 1
that he walked with God (Gen. v., 24; vi., 9 j i
Mai. ii., 6), but not all of his posterity

walked with God, or there would not be this;
record of this one. The Levltes were joined'
with the priests In the ministry of the temple
(Num. viii., 19). .
33. ""But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed,
came where he was, and when he
saw him he had compassion upon him."".
Let us remember tbat Jesus is talking to a
Jewish lawyer; that priests and Levltes
were the highest and supposed to be the
holiest of religious dignitaries among the
Jews, and that 8amaritans were a class with
whom the Jews had no dealings (John iv.,
9). There tore, Jesus is finding something
good in a despised outsider, as we might
say, in speaking thus of this Samaritan.
34. ""And went to him and bound up his
wounds, pouring in oil and wine, ana set
him on his own beast and brought him to an
inn and took care of him.1' Here is a wonderful
iftan surely, an outcast in Jewish
eyes, a worse than a nobody in the eyes ofj
priests and Levltes, but see his conduot and
observe that it is the Lord Jesus who is telling
us all this and learn at least one thing
?that it is not outward name or fame that
the Lord looks upon, but actions and motives.
85. ""And on the morrow, when he departed,
he took out twopence and gave them
to the nost and said unto him, Take care of
him, and whatsoever thou spondest more
when I come again I will repay tcee."" It ,
the poof, helpless one Is suggested of the
sinner, who can the good Samaratan be but
Jesus Himself, an outcast and despised by
the Jews, a nobody in the eyes of priests and
Levltes, scribes and Pharisees, yet Jsee His
heart full of compassion as He goes about
doing good.
86. ""Which now of those three, thinkest
thou, was neighbor unto him that fell among
the thieves?"" Jesus has not directly answered
the question, ""Who is my neighbor?""
but He has told His story. He has shown '
the picture, and now He would have the
lawyer answer his own question. Do not
fail to notice in the last verse the words,
""When I come again, I will repay thee,"" and
