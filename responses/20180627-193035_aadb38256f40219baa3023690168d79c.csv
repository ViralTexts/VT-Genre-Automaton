AN ACT
FOR ESTABLISHING RELIGIOUS
: FREEDOM..
. WRITTEN BY THOMAS JF.FFEBSOS.
Passed by the General Assembly of Vir­
ginia, December 16th, 1784. ,
1. Whereas, Almighty God iath .cre­
ated the mind free, that all attempts to
influence it by temporal punishments or
burtheus,or by civil incapacitation,tend on­
ly to beget habits of hypocrisy and mean­
ness, and are a departure from the .plan
of the Holy author of our religion, who
being Lord both of body and mind, yet
chose not to propagate it by coercions on
either, as was in his Almighty power to
do; that the impious presumption of Leg­
islators and Rulers, civil as well as eccle­
siastical, who being themselves but fallible
and uninspired men, have assumed domin­
ion over the faith of others, setting up
their own opinions and modes of thinking
as the only Jrue and infallible, and as such
endeavoring to impose them on others,
hath established and maintained false re­
ligious over the greatest part of the world,
and through all time; that to compel a
man to furnish contributions of money
for the propagation of opinions which he
disbelieves, is sinful and tyrannical; that
even the forcing him to support this or
that teacher of his own religious persua­
sion, is depriving him of the comfortable
liberty of giving his contributions to the
particular pastor, whose morals he would
make his patern, and whose powers he
feels most persuasive to righteousness,
and is withdrawing from the ministry
those temporal rewards, which, proceeding
from an approbation of their iersonal con­
duct, are an additional incitement to earn­
est and unremitting labors for the instruc­
tion of mankind; that our civil rights have
uo dependence on our religious opinions
any more than ur opinions of physics or
geometry; that therefore the proscribing
any citizen as unworthy the public confi­
dence, by laying upon him an incapacity
of being called to offices of trust and em­
olument unless he profess, or renounce this
or that religious opinion is depriving him
injuriously of those privileges and advan­
tages, to which, in common with hisfellow-citizens,
he has a natural right; that
it tends only to corrupt' the principles of
that religion it is meant to encourage, by
bribing with a monopoly of worldly hon­
ors and emoluments, those who will exter­
nally profess and conform to it; that though
indeed those are criminal who do not
withstand temptation, yet neither are
those innocent who lay the bait in their
way; that to suffer the civil magistrate to in­
trude his powers into the field of opinion,
and to restrain the profession or propoga­
tion of principles on supposition of their
ill tendency, is a dangerous fallacy, which
at once destroys all religious liberty, be­
cause he, being of course . judge of that
teudency, will make his opinion the rule of
judgment, and approve or condemn the
sentiments of others only ; as they shall
square with or differ from his own; that it
is time enough for the rightful purpose of
Civil Government, fyr its officers to inter­
fere when principles break out into overt
acts against peace and good order; and
finally, that Truth is great and will pre vail
if left to herself; that She is the proper and
sufficient antagonist to error, and has no­
thing to fear from the conflict, unless by
mman interposition disarmed of her nat
ural weapons, free argument and debate;
errors ceasing to be dangerous, when it
is permitted freely, to contradict them.
2. Be it enacted by the General Assem
bly, That no man shall be compelled to
frequent or support any religious worship,
place of Ministry ; whatsoever, nor shall
be enforced, restrained, molested, or bur-
thened iu his body or goods,-nor""shall he
otherwise suffer on account of his religious
opinions or belief; but tliat all men shall
be free to profess, and by argumeut to
maintain their opinions in matters of re­
ligion, and that the same in' no wise di­
minish, enlarge or affect their civil capac­
ities! V;: i; --K- .- :.- r
3. And though we; well know this As
sembly, elected by the people for the or
dinary purposes of legislation only, have
no power to restrain the acts of succeeding
Assemblies continued with powers equal
to our own, and that, therefore, to declare
this act to be irrevocable, would be of no
effect in law; yet we are free to declare,
that the rights hereby asserted, are of the
natual rights of mankind, and that, if any
act shall be hereafter passed to repeal the
present, or to narrow its operations, such
act will be an infringement of natural
right.' .'v r; -. : : ' ;
