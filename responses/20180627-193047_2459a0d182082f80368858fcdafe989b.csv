                 It is related that during the first few days of the reign of Queen Victoria, then a girl between nineteen and twenty years of age, some  of a court martial were presented for her signature. One was death, for desertion-a soldier was condemned to be shot, and hig death warrant was presented to the Queen for her signature. She read it, paused, looked up at the officer who laid it before tier, and said:
                 4 Have you nothing to say in behalf of, this man?""
                 Nothing! he has deserted three timers,"" said the officer.
                 T'i'hink again, my lord,"" was her reply.
                 ""And,"" said the veteran, as he related the circumstance to his friends, (for it was no other than the Duke of Wollingtoni) ""seeing Her Majesty so earnest about it, I said, ' He is certainly a very bad soldier, but there was somebody Who spoke as to his good character, and lie may be a good inan for aught I know to the contrary.'
                 "" I thank you a thousand times,"" exclaimed the youthful Queen, and hastily writing Pardoned in large letters on the  page, she sent it across the table with a hand trembling with emotion.
                 What a world of instruction, >goodness and true philosophy is contained in these two words, think again. Could we adopt their spirit as the rule of our lives one and all, what a happy change would come over society. In all our business concerns, in our social and moral relations, our political and religious duties, what important results might follow, if, on many, very many occasions, we would think again before deciding upon acting.
