Something About the K.vcslght, Which
Should be Knad and Jlcmembnred.

Persons speak of their eyes being fa­
tigued, meaning thereby that the seeing
portion of the brain is fatigued,
but in that, says Dr. W. W.
Seely, they are mistaken. So men say
their brains are tired. Brains seldom
become tired. The retina of the eye,
which is a part of the brain and an off­
shoot from it, hardly ever is tired.
The fatigue is in the inner and outer
muscles attached to the eye and in the
muscle of accommodation. The eye­
ball, resting in a bed of fat, has at­
tached to it six muscles for turning it
in any desired direction, and the mus­
cle attached to the side nearest the nose
and one at the outer angle of the eve
should, in every normal eye, be bal­
anced. They are used in converging
the eye on the object fo be viewed, and
the inner muscles are used the more
when tho object is the nearer. The
muscle of accommodation is one which
surrounds the lens of the eye. When it
is wanted to gaze at objects near at
hand, this muscle relaxes and allows
the lens to thicken, increasing
its refractive power at the same
time that the muscles on the in­
ner or nasal side of the eye contract and
direct the eyes to the point gazed at.
It is in these muscles that the fatigue is
felt, and one finds relief in closing the
eyes or iu gazing sit objects at a dis­
tance. The chief source of fatigue is
the lack of balance in the two sets of
inner and outer muscles of accommo­
dation. It may be set down that there
is something wrong when the eye be­
comes fatigued. The defective eye, as
i: gives out sooner, is really safer from
severe strains. The usual indication of
strain is a redness of the rim of the eye­
lid, betokening a congested state of the
inner surface, accompanied with some
pain. When it- is shown that the eye is
not equal to the work required of it, the
proper remedy is not rest, for that is
fatal to its strength, but the use of
glasses of sufficient power to render'
necessary so much effort in accommo­
dating the eye to vision. It is not good
sense to waste time iu resting the eye,'
and that practice does not strength-,
en it.

Eyes begin to age at about the tenth
or twelfth year of life, when they have
reached their full development. A.t the
age of forty-live or fifty years the lenses
cease to thicken, when the pressure is
removed and their presbyopia, or old1
sight, begins. When a child is com­
pelled to use or require the use of
glasses, there is little reason to hope!
that it will outgrow the need: but ""the
person will use these glasses as a basis,'
adding other glasses as ho reaches the!
age when old sight begins, or using
thicker glasses. Dr. Seely, however,
mentioned one case he had observed
where a child had outgrown the need
of glasses, but in the mean time he had.
grown from a small and puny child to
a large and well developed man.

Second sight or the apparent re­
covery of strength of vision, which is
sometimes seen in the aged, the lec­
turer explained as a changc, an elon­
gation, in the shape of the eyeball, by
which tho person became nearsighted,
accompanied by a change in the lens
caused by the appearance of cataract.
